            <p>The Typewriter will <u> not</u> accept any pieces containing bigotry of any kind. Though the art of sharing ones 
                stories is addicting, we do not condone any creations made to belittle/mock marginalized groups of people .</p>
            <h4>What We Are Looking For</h4>
            <p>We want writers to create pieces pretraining to the given theme in any way they interpret them. There is no wrong or right way
                 to go about writing a piece for our magazine. We want the pieces that make you smile at your screen, the ones you're eager to share, 
                the ones that make your fingers dance across your keyboard, and the ones that remind you why you love to write. </p>
